# claude-memory-compiler (PowerShell)

**Your Claude Code conversations compile themselves into a structured knowledge base.**

When a session ends (or before auto-compaction), hooks capture the conversation transcript and extract what matters in the background: decisions, lessons, patterns, gotchas. Everything accumulates in daily logs, which are then compiled into structured cross-referenced articles.

> Inspired by: **[coleam00/claude-memory-compiler](https://github.com/coleam00/claude-memory-compiler)** — the original Python/uv implementation of the same idea.
> Knowledge architecture based on [Andrej Karpathy's LLM Knowledge Base](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f).

This repository is a **native PowerShell port** for Windows: no Python, no uv, no virtual environments. Just `pwsh` and the `claude` CLI from your existing subscription.

## Key concept: scripts and data live in separate folders

```
E:\tools\claude-memory-compiler\   ← repo (scripts, hooks) — clone here
    brain.path                      ← one line: path to your brain

E:\my-brain\                        ← knowledge base (data) — configured in setup.ps1
    .claude\                        ← all memory compiler data (like .git/)
        daily\                      ← all conversations land here automatically
        knowledge\
        │   index.md                ← catalog (Type/Scope/Project/Domains/Summary)
        │   concepts\
        │   connections\
        └── qa\
        reports\
        domains.md                  ← domain vocabulary (controlled list)
        projects.json               ← registry: project → repo path + project domains
        domain-gaps.log             ← out-of-vocabulary domain candidates (from prompts)
```

`setup.ps1` asks where you want to store your data, saves the path to `brain.path`, and registers **global** Claude Code hooks. After that, **all your sessions from any project** feed into this one knowledge base.

To update scripts later: `git pull` — your brain data is untouched.

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`) — [download](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download) — CLI or IDE extension (already installed if you're reading this)
- No separate API key needed — uses your subscription via the `claude` CLI

---

## Installation

```powershell
# 1. Clone into the folder that will become your knowledge base (any name works)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-memory-compiler-ps E:\my-brain
cd E:\my-brain

# 2. Run setup — creates directories, configures global hooks, checks environment
pwsh -File setup.ps1
```

> **Recommended: run `setup.ps1` from a terminal inside Claude Desktop** — this ensures hooks are registered in the same environment where the app runs and will start capturing sessions immediately. Open a terminal tab inside Claude Desktop and run `pwsh` from there.
>
> `setup.ps1` configures `ExecutionPolicy` automatically (see below).

---

## PowerShell Permissions (one time)

Windows blocks `.ps1` scripts by default. Run **once**, no admin rights needed:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

`setup.ps1` does this automatically. After that — no more permission dialogs.

Claude Code hooks also show no dialogs: once registered in `settings.json`, they run silently.

### Manual hook configuration

Hooks can be configured **globally** (active across all projects) in `~\.claude\settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "pwsh -NonInteractive -File E:\\claude-memory-compiler\\hooks\\session-start.ps1", "timeout": 15 }]
    }],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "pwsh -NonInteractive -File E:\\claude-memory-compiler\\hooks\\user-prompt-submit.ps1", "timeout": 20 }]
    }],
    "PreCompact": [{
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "pwsh -NonInteractive -File E:\\claude-memory-compiler\\hooks\\pre-compact.ps1", "timeout": 10 }]
    }],
    "SessionEnd": [{
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "pwsh -NonInteractive -File E:\\claude-memory-compiler\\hooks\\session-end.ps1", "timeout": 10 }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Replace `E:\\claude-memory-compiler` with the actual installation path (double backslashes required in JSON).

### ⭐ Retroactive Compilation

Already using Claude Code before installing this tool? No problem — `retrocompile.ps1` scans all historical transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/` and compiles them into your knowledge base.

```powershell
# Dry run — see what would be processed
pwsh -File scripts\retrocompile.ps1 -DryRun

# Fast mode: script writes turns directly to daily logs → compile does 1 API call per day
# Runs in batch mode by default: progress report after every 5 sessions
pwsh -File scripts\retrocompile.ps1

# Batch of 10 sessions
pwsh -File scripts\retrocompile.ps1 -BatchSize 10

# No batching — process everything without intermediate reports
pwsh -File scripts\retrocompile.ps1 -NoBatch

# Quality mode: Claude summarizes each session individually → richer articles
pwsh -File scripts\retrocompile.ps1 -Mode Quality

# Process 20 sessions at a time (convenient for Quality mode)
pwsh -File scripts\retrocompile.ps1 -Mode Quality -Limit 20

# Specific projects only, from a given date
pwsh -File scripts\retrocompile.ps1 -Projects "my-saas","side-project" -Since 2026-01-01

# Fill daily logs only, skip compilation
pwsh -File scripts\retrocompile.ps1 -NoCompile

# Reprocess already-processed sessions
pwsh -File scripts\retrocompile.ps1 -Force
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `-Mode` | `Fast` or `Quality` | `Fast` |
| `-Projects` | Filter by project name (substring) | all |
| `-MinTurns` | Minimum turns per session | `3` |
| `-Since` | Only sessions from `YYYY-MM-DD` | all time |
| `-Limit` | Max **processed** sessions per run | unlimited |
| `-BatchSize` | Progress report after every N sessions | `5` |
| `-NoBatch` | Disable batch mode | — |
| `-DryRun` | Show plan without changes | — |
| `-Force` | Reprocess tracked sessions | — |
| `-NoCompile` | Fill daily logs only, skip compile | — |

> **How `-Limit` is counted:** the limit applies only to sessions that are actually processed — i.e. those that pass the `-MinTurns` threshold and get summarized or written. Already-processed sessions and sessions that are too short don't count toward the limit, but the script still has to scan past them.
>
> Example: your archive has 200 short test sessions (1–2 turns) and 10 meaningful ones. `-Limit 5` will make the script scroll through all 200 short sessions to find 5 good ones — and only then stop. This is expected behaviour: short sessions are marked as skipped in `retro-processed.json` along the way, so on the next run they are skipped instantly.

**Two modes explained:**

- **Fast** — the script writes conversation turns directly to daily logs (no API call), then `compile.ps1` extracts knowledge. ~1 API call per day. Ideal for processing your entire archive at once.
- **Quality** — Claude summarizes each session individually (like `flush.ps1`), then compile. ~1 API call per session. Better for selectively processing important projects.

The script remembers processed sessions in `retro-processed.json` — repeated runs are safe, already-processed sessions are skipped.

## Global vs project knowledge

The knowledge base is shared across all projects, but not every lesson is universal. Each article is tagged in its frontmatter:

- `scope: global | project` — `global` is useful everywhere (PowerShell/OS/tool behaviour), `project` belongs to a single project only (DB schema, field names, a specific system's API keys, business logic).
- `source_project` — which project the lesson came from (the git repo root's folder name). Hooks derive it from the session's `cwd` and write a `_Проект:_` provenance line into the daily log; the compiler uses it to route knowledge per project.
- `type: concept | rule` — `rule` is an imperative do/don't/gotcha lesson; rules are surfaced first.

**Injection filter.** `session-start.ps1` reads the current project from `cwd` and injects the current project's articles plus `scope: global` articles **filtered by the project's domains** (see the Domains section). In project A you no longer see project B's facts — less noise, fewer tokens.

**Where scope is decided.** The compiler (`compile.ps1`) classifies at write time, biased toward `global` (losing a global lesson inside one project is worse than re-tagging a local fact). `lint.ps1` is an auditor: it flags suspicious scope but never moves anything.

> `knowledge/index.md` is rebuilt deterministically by `reindex.ps1` from frontmatter — the `session-start` filter relies on the `Scope`/`Project`/`Domains` columns, so the index is built by code, not the LLM.

---

## Domains: a second tagging axis

On top of `scope`/`source_project`, every article carries a `domains: [..]` field — applicability tags drawn from a **controlled vocabulary** in `.claude/domains.md` (one domain per line). A second relevance axis (`wordpress`, `css-frontend`, `python`, `amocrm`…).

- **Auto-tagging.** `tag-domains.ps1` is a pipeline step: `compile.ps1` calls it after writing articles and before `reindex`. The vocabulary is closed — anything not in `domains.md` is dropped. A content hash gate means only new or changed articles are reclassified (`-Force` re-tags everything).
- **Project domains.** `project-domains.ps1` (the `/domains` command) stores a project's domains in `projects.json`; `brain-stats.ps1` (the `/brain` command) reports the size of the injected context.

### Domain injection filter

`session-start` injects a `scope: global` article only if its domains **intersect the project's domains**. The rule is **fail-closed**: an article with no domains, or a project with an empty profile → global is not injected. The project's own articles (`scope: project`) are always injected; domains don't gate them. The predicate is `Test-RowInjected` in `scripts/_config.ps1`, shared with `/brain` so the report and the actual injection never drift. Kill switch: `$DOMAIN_FILTER` in `_config.ps1` (`$false` → previous behaviour, all global).

### Auto-populating the profile from prompts

You don't have to maintain the project's domain profile by hand — it accrues on its own. The **`UserPromptSubmit`** hook (`hooks/user-prompt-submit.ps1`) makes one lightweight-model call per prompt and:

1. classifies the prompt against the `domains.md` vocabulary (`$DOMAINIZE_MODEL`, defaults to `claude-haiku-4-5`);
2. adds any missing domains to the project's profile (`projects.json`) and asks the assistant to mention it in the chat;
3. **tops up the current session immediately** with the added domain's `global` articles (which weren't in the start-of-session injection);
4. if the prompt is clearly about an area **outside the vocabulary**, writes a candidate line to `.claude/domain-gaps.log` for manually extending `domains.md`.

> Domains are only ever added (a ratchet); remove a wrong one by hand — `/domains -<domain>`. The stream is self-quenching: the vocabulary is finite, only missing domains get added.

### Legacy bulk review (Excel)

For hand-tagging a large existing knowledge base there is a semi-automatic pass through Excel:

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts\suggest-domains.ps1     # 1. LLM domain suggestions → domain-suggestions.json
pwsh -File scripts\export-review.ps1       # 2. build review.xlsx (one checkbox column per domain)
#                                            3. edit review.xlsx by hand
pwsh -File scripts\apply-review.ps1        # 4. read xlsx back → frontmatter, then reindex + lint
pwsh -File scripts\apply-review.ps1 -DryRun  # preview without writing
```

This is the **only Python part of the project**: building and reading `.xlsx` go through `build-review-xlsx.py` / `read-review-xlsx.py`, which `export-review`/`apply-review` invoke for you. Requires Python 3 and `openpyxl` (`py -m pip install openpyxl`). The brain path is passed in from PowerShell as an argument — no hardcoded paths.

## How It Works

```
Conversation
  → SessionEnd / PreCompact hooks (file I/O + project detection from cwd)
  → scripts\flush.ps1 in background (claude -p: what's worth saving?)
  → daily\YYYY-MM-DD.md (daily log with a _Проект:_ provenance line)
  → scripts\compile.ps1 (claude -p: articles + scope / source_project / type)
  → scripts\tag-domains.ps1 (domains from the vocabulary into frontmatter, hash-gated)
  → scripts\reindex.ps1 (deterministic index.md from frontmatter)
  → knowledge\concepts\, connections\, qa\ (knowledge base articles)
  → SessionStart hook injects the CURRENT project's index (project articles + global∩domains)
  → UserPromptSubmit hook: each prompt's domains → project profile + top-up of their global articles
  → cycle repeats
```

### Components

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `hooks\session-end.ps1` | Captures transcript at session end |
| `hooks\pre-compact.ps1` | Safety net: captures context before auto-compaction |
| `hooks\session-start.ps1` | Injects the **current project's** index (project articles + global, filtered by the project's domains) |
| `hooks\user-prompt-submit.ps1` | Per prompt: prompt's domains → project profile (`projects.json`), top-up of their global articles, log of out-of-vocab candidates (`domain-gaps.log`) |
| `scripts\flush.ps1` | Background process: extracts knowledge from conversation |
| `scripts\compile.ps1` | Compiles daily logs into articles + classifies scope/type |
| `scripts\reindex.ps1` | Rebuilds `index.md` deterministically from frontmatter |
| `scripts\reclassify.ps1` | One-shot legacy reclassification (scope/type/source_project) |
| `scripts\retrocompile.ps1` | **Retroactive compilation** of historical sessions into the knowledge base |
| `scripts\tag-domains.ps1` | Tags articles with domains from the vocabulary (compile step, hash-gated) |
| `scripts\suggest-domains.ps1` | LLM domain suggestions into JSON (for the Excel review) |
| `scripts\project-domains.ps1` | A project's domains in `projects.json` (the `/domains` command) |
| `scripts\list-no-domains.ps1` | Lists articles with no domains yet |
| `scripts\brain-stats.ps1` | Size of the project's injected context (the `/brain` command) |
| `scripts\export-review.ps1` | Exports articles into `review.xlsx` for manual domain/scope review |
| `scripts\apply-review.ps1` | Applies the edited `review.xlsx` back into frontmatter |
| `scripts\*-review-xlsx.py` | Python+openpyxl: build/read `review.xlsx` (invoked from PS) |
| `scripts\query.ps1` | Queries the knowledge base |
| `scripts\lint.ps1` | 8 knowledge base health checks (incl. scope audit) |
| `scripts\_api.ps1` | Utilities: `claude` CLI calls + file-op parsing |
| `scripts\_config.ps1` | Path constants + project/frontmatter helpers |

### Why PowerShell instead of Python?

| | Python (`uv run`) | PowerShell |
|---|---|---|
| Startup time | 2–4 sec | ~0 sec |
| Hook timeout | 10 sec — risky | 10 sec — fine |
| Dependencies | uv, venv, packages | built-in |
| JSON | `json.loads()` | `ConvertFrom-Json` |
| HTTP | `httpx` / `requests` | `Invoke-RestMethod` |

| Operation | Approximate cost |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Flush one session | ~$0.02–0.05 |
| Compile one daily log | ~$0.45–0.65 |
| Tag domains (one article) | ~$0.02–0.05 |
| Domainize a prompt (per prompt) | ~$0.001–0.003 (Haiku) |
| Retrocompile Fast (full archive) | ~$0.45–0.65 × number of days |
| Retrocompile Quality (one session) | ~$0.02–0.05 |
| Query the knowledge base | ~$0.15–0.25 |
| Lint (structural only) | $0.00 |
| Lint (with contradiction check) | ~$0.15–0.25 |

Compile/flush/tagging use `claude-sonnet-4-6`; prompt domainization uses `claude-haiku-4-5`. Models are set in `scripts\_config.ps1` (`$DEFAULT_MODEL`, `$DOMAINIZE_MODEL`).
